            <h1>The Details</h1>
            <h2>WHAT</h2>
            <p>The content on a website needs formating. In other words, it needs a layout for each page, specific fonts, colored
                backgrounds, and so on. This is where CSS comes in. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a computer
                language that works with another computer language, HTML, to make your pages look pretty. We say they are
                "styled." </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    <em>Cascading&nbsp;</em>
                </b>means that the styling rules are written as if they are flowing down the page, with indented elements inheriting
                the style of their parent element. </p>

            <h2>WHY</h2>
            <p>Style sheets have existed the 1980&apos;s. People, most likely developers, needed style sheets to be from many
                different sources, rather than embeded in the browser code. They needed different style sheets for printing
                and screen readers.</p>

            <h2>WHO, WHEN, and WHERE</h2>
            <p>While Hakon Wium Lie, pictured here, is credited as a co-creator of the CSS, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
                developed the standard for it. Mr. Lie, from Norway, was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Switzerland
                when he proposed the idea on October 10, 1994. </p>
            <p>The W3C at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts released the 1st version of CSS (CSS 1) in 1996.</p>
